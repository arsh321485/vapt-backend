I am working on an Admin Assets module.

There are two roles: Super Admin and Admin.

Requirement:

The Super Admin uploads a file (asset/vulnerability report) for a specific Admin.

Each uploaded file has a report_id and is mapped to an admin_id.

In the Admin Asset application, data should be fetched and displayed based on the report_id.

An Admin should only see asset data that belongs to them, based on:

admin_id

report_id generated during Super Admin file upload

Admin must not see data uploaded for other admins.

What I need from you:

API logic to fetch assets based on admin_id and report_id

Proper filtering at the backend level

Example request & response structure

Best practice for validating admin access

remove the location_id ,location_name
